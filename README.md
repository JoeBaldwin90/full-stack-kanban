# Full-Stack Kanban App
A full-stack MERN app for managing projects, the 'Kanban' way. 

This project was built as part of a code-along Pluralsight course. I have worked with React, Redux, MongoDB, Node.js and Express separately before taking this course. But I'd not seen how they all fit together and ultimately end up being hosted on a platform like Heroku.
