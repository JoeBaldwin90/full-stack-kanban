# Full-Stack Kanban App
A full-stack MERN app for managing tasks, the 'Kanban' way. 

This project was built as part of a code-along Pluralsight course. I have worked with React, Redux, MongoDB, Node.js and Express separately before taking this course. But I'd not seen how they all fit together in a MERN stack and ultimately end up being hosted on a platform like Heroku.

## Lessons Learned
This project has concreted my previously shaky understanding of how React, Redux and Redux Middleware (e.g. Sagas) work together. In particular, I now understand how elegant it is to build an app without mutating the original state with methods like `Object.assign()` and `.map()`. I also appreciate why middleware like Redux Sagas are necessary to handle asynchronous and impure functions. I feel like I've entered a new era of React understanding and I'm excited to dive deeper. 

Besides the above, seeing how Node.js and Express can be used with React has filled an otherwise gaping hole in my web development knowledge. Although I've built quite a rudimentary server to support this project, I now know that it's not as scary as I'd otherwise thought to get started with a full-stack MERN application. Having built full-stack apps with Ruby on Rails before, I was a bit intimidated by the number of different technologies that I'd have to learn and pull together. 

I've only worked with PostgreSQL before, so this was my first time working with a non-relational database like MongoDB. It wasn't as difficult as I thought to get started with it and tools like "Robo3T" helped me to visualise my data and manually correct it during development. 
 
## Future Development
